        She’s a 10th grader—and a full-time history nerd (the proud kind). Her love for history didn’t begin in a classroom. It started quietly, on a rainy afternoon, when she stumbled upon a book about World War II.
<br/>
Since that moment, history has captivated her—not just the wars, but everything it holds: resistance, courage, injustice, silence. She began asking questions.
Why don’t we hear more about certain people?
<br/>
What happened to the everyday voices that never made it into textbooks?
Why does history often feel so flat, when it’s anything but?
<br/>
While most people scroll past dusty old wars, she’s the one zooming into battle maps and poring over ancient tactics. Her biggest fascination? The wars and forgotten narratives of India. Because let’s be honest—India’s history is epic. From empires rising and falling to hidden heroes lost in time, she’s on a mission to unravel the layers of India’s past and bring those untold stories to light.
