    <b>Vision</b>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"><span className='text-3xl font-bold'>Project Echo </span>was born on a quiet, rainy afternoon not in a classroom. I stumbled upon a forgotten book about World War II, and everything changed. My love for history didn’t begin with dates and definitions it began with a question: Why haven’t I heard this story before?

Since then, I’ve been drawn not just to grand events, but to the voices lost between the lines stories of resistance, silence, courage, injustice, and everyday lives erased by time.

Project Echo is a podcast but more than that, it's a living conversation. It brings together historians, scholars, and curious minds to explore India’s rich past in a way that feels alive, personal, and deeply relevant. From ancient civilizations and freedom movements to regional narratives and forgotten people, we aim to amplify the voices of those who’ve been overlooked.
<br/>
Through heartfelt dialogue, critical reflection, and boundless curiosity, Project Echo is here to make history feel like more than facts and timelines it’s here to help us see that history isn’t just behind us. It’s within us.</p>
